    Martin martin martin , once the theme song is heard you know that what ever happens on the 
    televison for the next thirty minutes will have you laughing , chilling , or wondering why 
    tommy has no job yet. Martin aired in august of 1992 and was broadcasted on television for
    five seasons with a total of 132 episodes. Martin and his wife gina (tisha cambell) go 
    through day to day life living as young adults trying to be the best in there career paths.
    Martin has two friends tommy (Thomas Mikal Ford) and cole (Carl Anthony Payne II) while gina
    has her one home girl pam (Tichina Arnold) who martin just cant help but to crack jokes on 
    every chance he gets. Martin is pertrayed to be this cocky radio show host that is sexist and 
    a total goof ball. His girlfriend gina and eventual wife works at a public-relations firm 
    and so does her best friend pam and as for tommy and cole , well tommy hasn't had a job but 
    claims to through the entire series and coles works at an airport

    Martins day to day life has him in and out of trouble , wether it be his wife with relationship 
    problems or his friends dragging him into there mess or vice versa , or maybe momma payne being 
    over protective of her son martin and so on and so for. My favorite episode of martin
